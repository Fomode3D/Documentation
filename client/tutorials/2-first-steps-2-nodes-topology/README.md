### How to perform simple TL operations and payments

<br/>
<br/>

All operations in GEO Network are performed through the trust lines. <br/>
In this tutorial we would run 2 nodes in common network, connect them with a trust line, and perform several payment operations.

<br/>

## Nodes toplogy

The overall topology we are going to create looks like this:

</p>

In this topology, node `A` trusts node `B` **$100**, so node `B` is able to pay to node `A` up to $100. <br/>
In the same time, node `A` is not able to pay to node `B` because node `B` does not trust to the node `A`.

<br/>

## Step 1: Topology creation

Now we are going to launch the nodes into docker's internal network. <br/>
Please, refer to the [first tutorial](https://github.com/GEO-Protocol/Documentation/tree/master/client/tutorials/1-docker-initialisation) for the details how to run the container with a node.

Please, open 2 terminals and perform the next commands in each one:

```bash
> sudo docker run -i -t geoprotocol/network-client-beta 172.17.0.2 # Node A

> sudo docker run -i -t geoprotocol/network-client-beta 172.17.0.3 # Node B
```

</p>


Now we should ensure, that 2 containers are running in internal network:

```bash
> sudo docker network inspect bridge
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/GEO-Protocol/Documentation/blob/master/client/tutorials/2-first-steps-2-nodes-topology/resources/3.png">
</p>

As we see, our 2 containers are running well and are allocating 2 internal IPv4 addresses: `172.17.0.2` and `172.17.0.3`. Please, pay attention which container is allocating which address. Your containers IDs are different from those in tutorial, so be patient!

**Warning:**
Please, ensure you are starting node `A` (`172.17.0.2`) first. 
Otherwise docker would assign it different address, and in this case yous should change the host parameter that is passed into the `run` command.

**Warning:**
In case if you docker environment uses different network subnet â€” ensure correct host parameter in `run` command.

# Step 2: Opening communication channels

Communication channels are used by nodes to perform secure packets exchange. All trust lines operations require settled communication channel.

### Opening CC on node A

```bash
> curl -X POST "http://172.17.0.2:3000/api/v1/node/contractors/init-channel/?contractor_address=12-172.17.0.3:2000"
```
