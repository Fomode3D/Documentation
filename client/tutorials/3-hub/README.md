One of the main advantages of the GEO Protocol is ability to perform payments that are involving several middleware nodes _(up to 5 nodes in a path)_. In this tutorial we would show how the topology should be creted so this kind of payments would be possible.

Also, in this tutorial we would cover special kind of nodes, called "hubs" â€” the nodes, that have dozens of trust-lines open with various nodes in the network.
