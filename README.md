# GEO Protocol

GEO Protocol is a decentralized p2p protocol that uses state channels and trust lines technologies and implements its own routing algorithm as well. 
The protocol works without blockchain and is able to connect different ledgers. Initially, that was an original Ripple's idea, but we have improved it by adding state channels due to blockchain technology progress

**_There are 4 algorithms used in GEO Protocol:_**
1. Payment algorithm
2. Calculation of payment possibilities algorithm
3. Routing algorithm
4. Cyclic clearing algorithm

Recently we published [specification for payment algorithm](https://github.com/GEO-Protocol/specs-protocol/blob/master/transactions/transactions.md) which called *Twin Spark*.
Proposed solution provides ability for up to several hundreds participants to achieve 100% consensus via communications through potentially unstable and untrusted environment, under active fraud attempts of malicious participants.
