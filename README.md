# What is GEO Protocol?

GEO Protocol is a decentralized p2p protocol that uses state channels and trust lines technologies and implements its own routing algorithm as well. 
The protocol works without blockchain and is able to connect different ledgers. Initially, that was an original Ripple's idea, but we have improved it by adding state channels due to blockchain technology progress

## How It Works?
A stack of protocols using a number of high-tech algorithms for connections search and clearing among system participants in a distributed decentralized network. Technically, the system is designed and implemented as a peer-to-peer network, in which the entire spectrum of computing and security functions is distributed among users' devices. It has a number of essential components and elements, which are the basis for numerous solutions and use cases development:

* **Node** — a device of any kind (from smartphone to datacenter of any organization conducting thousands of transactions), keeping the information about transactions conducted from/to a node and acts as an asset holder.

* **Channels** — assets in the network are sent among participants via asset transfer channels. They reflect the participant's willingness to accept the obligations of another network member expressed in digital equivalents, not exceeding the established by a node holder limit. In fact, a transaction executed via a channel is a smart contract signed by both parties.

* **Payment algorithm (transaction chains up to 6 lines)** — one of the main advantages of the system is that transactions can be executed through the transfer (or repayment) of obligations through a chain of links. In such a way, each node is part of a unified logistics network for processing payments or transferring assets. If there is no direct link between nodes - they can execute the transaction by "routing and finding the path" between them, i.e. build a chain of links (up to six links) through the intermediate nodes. The amount of available payment in this case (one payment path) will be equal to the smallest of the bandwidth limits (nodes).


## How you can use protocol?
Use Case | Description
--- | ---
**Payment solutions**   | Non-blockchain, fast, real-time, double-spending resistant, distributed multi-attendee payment crypto- protocol with time predictable 100% participants consensus. GEO protocol helps users safely send and receive payments in P2P marketplaces. It greatly enhances the buying/selling process with decentralized escrow for secure payments, third party dispute resolution, and very low transaction costs.
**Loyalty programs**   | We are providing a platform for building loyalty programs and developer interface, enabling customization of loyalty application for any request. Using GEO protocol brands will benefit from simple development and customization, low management costs and the elimination of liabilities associated with unredeemed points.
**Rating systems and delegated democracy**   | The transitivity of trust reflects the amount of value that can be trusted to a node. It has a numeric measurement so the platform gives a tool to evaluate the rate or amount of trust, loyalty or support.
**Clearing systems**   | Possibility to implement the automatic clearing with elimination of double expenditure up to 6 participants in a chain
**Interoperability protocol**   | Geo protocol can act as a cross-chain protocol enabling interaction and interoperability among different blockchains. This makes instant payments across a network of participants easy and cheap.
**IoT solutions**   | P2P protocol enabling the scalable, secure, private and high trusted method to perform IoT transactions with participation of unlimited number of nodes.
**Mobile money operators transactions (protocol level)**  | P2P transaction protocol using SMS or any mobile app to perform transfer of funds. Nodes can be represented by phone numbers. The access to all online services is provided via duplication of accounts to the online distributed ledger.
