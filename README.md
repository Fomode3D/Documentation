# GEO Protocol

GEO Protocol is a decentralized p2p protocol that uses state channels and trust lines technologies and implements its own routing algorithm as well. 
The protocol works without blockchain and is able to connect different ledgers. Initially, that was an original Ripple's idea, but we have improved it by adding state channels due to blockchain technology progress

There are 4 algorithms used in GEO Protocol:
1. Paying algorithm
2. Calculation of payment possibilities algorithm
3. Routing algorithm
4. Cyclic clearing algorithm

Recently we published [first specification](https://github.com/GEO-Protocol/specs-protocol/blob/master/transactions/transactions.md)
