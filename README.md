# GEO Protocol

GEO Protocol is a decentralized p2p protocol for values exchange that uses state channels and trust lines technologies and implements its own routing algorithm as well. 
This is a protocol that is able to build a global decentralized P2P network which connects different ledgers.
The protocol works without blockchain and uses off-chain solutions that provide scalability of the network. 
Our purpose is to make value exchange as simple as sending email.

**_There are 4 algorithms used in GEO Protocol:_**
1. Payment algorithm
2. Calculation of payment possibilities algorithm
3. Routing algorithm
4. Cyclic clearing algorithm

**_Update for 12.10.2018_** /
We published [specification for payment algorithm](https://github.com/GEO-Protocol/specs-protocol/blob/master/transactions/transactions.md) which called *Twin Spark*.
Proposed solution provides ability for up to several hundreds participants to achieve 100% consensus via communications through potentially unstable and untrusted environment, under active fraud attempts of malicious participants.

**_Update for 15.10.2018_** / 
We published [specification that describes the trust lines algorithm](https://github.com/GEO-Protocol/specs-protocol/blob/master/trust_lines/trust_lines.md) which called *Twin State*.
Proposed solution provides ability for 2 participants to share common state of a trust line / channel and syncronise it with quantum resistant proof of operations performed.
