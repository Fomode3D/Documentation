# How to run
### Installation
1. Download/Build last node version from the [repo](https://github.com/GEO-Protocol/GEO-network-client); <br/>
You can follow the links provided in [releases changelogs](https://github.com/GEO-Protocol/GEO-network-client/blob/develop/RELEASES.md) to get desired version of the node build (currently, only BETA1 is available).

1. Move `geo_network_client` to the desired FS location. <br/>
The default location for the node in `~/node/`, but you are free to chose any other location. <br/>
If you are using provided [WM image](https://github.com/GEO-Protocol/GEO-network-client/blob/develop/RELEASES.md#beta-1) (or docker container) - it is already configured. No need to go through this step.


1. Prepeare the configuration. <br/>
Please, follow instructions from a section "Configuration".

1. Start the node: `./geo_network_client` <br/>
In case of successfull fly node should report
* core and required subsystems initialisation messages;
* current observers chain height.

![node_run.png](https://github.com/GEO-Protocol/Documentation/blob/master/resources/node_run.png)

In case if node was not started as expected - please, refer to the `operations.log`. 
Usually it contains some details abot the error occured. 

After the first launch of the node, the following objects appear in the node’s directory:
* The `io` directory, that contains two files: `storageDB` and `communicatorStorageDB`. 
This two files stores all the node’s data: trustlines, keys, history, payments, routing tables, etc.
* The `fifo` directory, that contains three files: `commands.fifo`, `results.fifo` and `events.fifo`. The node’s communication will happen through these files. 
* The `operations.log` file containing detailed log of network actions (still needs some polishing).
* The `process.pid` file containing the `PID` of the runnig node.
<br/>
<br/>

### Libraries required
GEO Network Client uses `boost` libraries and `libsodium` for the cryptography. </br> 
Please, enshure presense of this libraries in you env. before starting the node.
<br/>
<br/>

### Configuration
Configuration contains network interfaces that should be used by the node and reported to the rest of the network, 
as well as addresses of the observers, that are expected to be present in the network.

**Note: Beta 1 release supports only static, publicly available IPv4 addresses.** <br/>
So, in case if you are planning to try to launch several nodes and perform some operations between them, - 
please, ensure, that all of them would be able to communicate to each other via `UDP/IPv4` interface.

**Note: Beta 1 release supports only statically listed observers list** <br/>
The protocol itself is expected to support dynamically formed observers list, provided by the GSR [#todo link to GSR description].
</br>
</br>

Configuration file is named `conf.json`. <br/> 
It is required to be located **on the same FS level** as `geo_network_client`. </br>
![node_settings_fs_level.png](https://github.com/GEO-Protocol/Documentation/blob/master/resources/node_settings_fs_level.png)


The configuration file must contain addresses information of the node – `addresses`: 
all the addresses that identify the node (including ports, if related) and their types, as well as the list of the [Observers](https://github.com/GEO-Protocol/Observer) – `observers`. <br/>
<br/>
In the current version of the node only one type of addressing is supported – ipv4.<br/>
</br>
Currently, observers test. net is driven by only 4 observers. 
It is fully enough for providing all necessary operations for the GEO nodes and the GEO Network Test net.
At the moment, **observers do not check validity of the TSLs/Claims generated by the GEO Nodes**, 
so this network is not suitable for production usage, but is able to provide observing functionality that fully covers BETA1 release needs. The production environment is expected to be driven by the 1024+ observers. 

_Configuration for the BETA1 test net:_
```
{
  "addresses":
  [
    {
      "type":"ipv4",
      "address":"127.0.0.1:2000"
    }
  ],
	"observers":
  [
    {
      "address":"68.183.146.232:4000",
      "type":"ipv4"
    },													
    {
      "address":"46.101.51.158:4000",
      "type":"ipv4"
    },
    {
      "address":"206.189.84.116:4000",
      "type":"ipv4"
    },
    {
      "address":"159.89.115.33:4000",
      "type":"ipv4"
    }
  ]
}
```
</br>
The node’s addresses will be used to identify the node and they will be stored at other nodes with which the current node will communicate in either way: opening a trustline – TL, making payments, etc. Therefore, changing the address of the node after it has already opened some TLs will lead to incorrect work with the corresponding nodes.


</br>
</br>

# How to use the node
Here we will describe several ways possible how to communicate with the node. <br/>
For the simplicity reasons, the documentation is provided in format of tutorial.

## Basic overview
Node represents _an account_ in GEO Network. <br/>
_It is assumed, each one participant of the GEO Network would access the network via it's own node_. <br/>
In contrast to some other decentralized networks, GEO Network does not delegate calculations to the miners, 
but assumes network participants would take part (only) in transactions, in which them are involved.

GEO Network Client implements such a node and provides low-level API 
for operations processing: assets transfers, trust-lines/channels accounting, etc.
</br>
</br>
For the simplicity reasons, in this tutorial we would use provided WM image. 
You can find the latest images with latest node build in [GEO Network Client repo](https://github.com/GEO-Protocol/GEO-network-client) ("Releases" section of the description).
<br/>

## VirtualBox configuration
We would need SSH session to manipulate the nodes, so the WM should accept incoming TCP connections. <br/>
The simples way to achieve it is to configure NAT Ports Forwarding for the destination WM.

	Pord Forwarding Settings
</p>
<br/>
<br/>


## Network topology
In this tutorial we would use 3 nodes: `node1`, `node2`, `node3`. <br/>
We would use one WM to run all three nodes. You can follow this tutorial in the same way, or you can launch 3 different WMs and configure appropriate network layer so all the WMs would be able to communicate to each other WM.

Each one node needs one SSH session to be launched in, and one more SSH session for the commands transferring and results fetching. So in total, we are opening 6 SSH sessions to the WM.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/GEO-Protocol/Documentation/blob/master/resources/ssh_1.png">
	SSH into the WM
</p>
<br/>
<br/>

```
User: geo
Pass: geo
```

We should copy original `node` dir 3 times:

1. `cd ~`
1. `cp ./node ./node1 -r`
1. `cp ./node ./node2 -r`
1. `cp ./node ./node3 -r`

And make corresponding changes to the configuration files:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/GEO-Protocol/Documentation/blob/master/resources/node1_config.png">
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/GEO-Protocol/Documentation/blob/master/resources/node2_config.png">
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/GEO-Protocol/Documentation/blob/master/resources/node3_config.png">
</p>


Then, we need to launch the nodes. <br/>
For it to be done, follow the next steps:

1. Sitch to `node1` SSH sesssion and do: `cd ~/node1/ && ./geo_network_client`
1. Sitch to `node2` SSH sesssion and do: `cd ~/node2/ && ./geo_network_client`
1. Sitch to `node3` SSH sesssion and do: `cd ~/node3/ && ./geo_network_client`

Please, refer to the "How to run" section of this doc for the details about how node could be started and what behaviour of it to expect in various cases.


## Node communication
There are 3 possible ways to communicate to the GEO node:
1. **Via low-level GEO Node protocol** <br/>
This is the most performant and the most flexible way of communication, but in the same time, the most complex one.
This communication channel should be used in production environments or embedded systems 
with maximum performance in mind, and to avoid addtional resource consupting layers of communication (for example, HTTP API).

1. **Via command-line interface** [comming soon] <br/> 
This interface provides ability to communicate with node from the console in mode "one command at a time". </br>
It is useful during development, but it should not be considered to be used in production environments, 
due to the limitations of concurent commands processing, and relatively high resouce usage per command execution.

1. **Via JSON API** [comming soon] <br/>
This interface provides ability to communicate with node via HTTP API and to process more than one command at a time. 
It is useful during development, and also might be considered to be used in production environments, 
that are configured for communication with only one, or several nodes.


# Low-level GEO Node protocol
## How to send command to the node
All commands have to be transferred to the `commands.fifo` pipe. 
The node at the start opens this file for reading immediately, so once a command gets there, it will be processed at once.<br/>

The results of the command execution will be written by the node into the `results.fifo` pipe. This file must be opened for reading **before the start of the node**, otherwise the node will freeze at the first attempt to write a result. Since we do not have the `results.fifo` pipe (as well as other files) initially, we have to run the node first to form all these files. Then we have to stop it, and all the next times we will have to open the `results.fifo` file for reading before the node start.<br/>
<br/>
The `events.fifo` file is planned for recording the node’s internal events (incoming payments, opening an outgoing TL, etc.). But this functionality is not implemented yet, so this file can be ignored so far.

All commands and results consist of plain text data separated by the tab symbol `\t`, and ends with the end of the line symbol `\n`. The command and the result start with a 16-byte `command UUID` (UUID4 hex representation) that should be generated by the command issuer.

Each command consist of `command UUID`, command name, and comamnd arguments.

You can use standard linux command `echo` to send command to the node directly from the shell: <br/>
`echo -e "<command>" > fifo/commands.fifo` <br/>
Argument `-e` forces `echo` to interpet `\t` as tab character and `\n` as line end character.
<br/>
<br/>

## How to read command result
1. Move to the node directory: `cd ~/node` </br>
1. Open `./fifo/results.fifo` for reading. It is a linux-pipe (fifo-file), so it would not open, until the node is not launched as well (pipe opens in read mode only if there is another process that has opened it for the writing). <br/> 
`cat ./fifo/results.fifo` </br>
In this case, `cat` would hang, until node would be launched and some command-results would be written.

This approach might be combined with commands transferring in common shell in the next way:
```
> cat fifo/results.fifo & # read results in background

> echo -e "<command 1>" > fifo/commands.fifo
> echo -e "<command 2>" > fifo/commands.fifo
> ...
> echo -e "<command n>" > fifo/commands.fifo
```

</br>
</br>

## Transaction: Initialise a Trust Line
```
INIT:contractors/trust-line
```

|Argument|Description
|---|---|
|Number of contractor’s addresses| How many addresses of the contractor would be included into the cpmmand|
|Vector of addresses of the contractor| Vector of pairs `(address type; address)`. As was mentioned above, the node currently supports only one type of address: `IPv4`, and its type code is `12`|
| Equivalent ID | ID if the [equivalent](https://github.com/GEO-Protocol/specs-protocol/blob/master/trust_lines/trust_lines.md#trust-lines-equivalents) in which TL (Trust Line) should be opened: an integer greater than 0. |

This command initialises a Trust Line with contractor. 
The transaction involves both current node and contractor's node. Ensures cryptographic keys exchange.

#### Example
```
> echo -e "13e5cf8c-5834-4e52-b65b-f9281dd1ff91\tINIT:contractors/trust-line\t1\t12\t127.0.0.1:2002\t1\n" > fifo/commands.fifo
```

![init_trust_line.png](https://github.com/GEO-Protocol/Documentation/blob/master/resources/init_trust_line.png)

### Response
Code 200: OK, operation was performed well. No additional data is provided.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## Transaction: Trust Lines List
```
GET:contractors/trust-lines
```

|Argument|Description
|---|---|
| Offset | Number of the trust line from which the scan should be started. |
| Count | How many TLs should be returned. |
| Equivalent ID | ID if the [equivalent](https://github.com/GEO-Protocol/specs-protocol/blob/master/trust_lines/trust_lines.md#trust-lines-equivalents) in which TL (Trust Line) should be opened: an integer greater than 0. |

Returns no more than `Count` of Trust Lines that are present on the node and corresponds to the received `offset` and `equivalent`.
`todo:` add link to te transaction in source code.

### Example
```
> echo -e "13e5cf8c-5834-4e52-b65b-f9281dd1ff91\tGET:contractors/trust-lines\t0\t1\t1\n" > fifo/commands.fifo
```
![init_trust_line.png](https://github.com/GEO-Protocol/Documentation/blob/master/resources/tl_list.png)

### Response
* The result code: 200 – completed successfully;
* total number of TLs returned;
* TL’s vector:
  * Contractor’s ID
  * Contractor’s addresses
  * TL state
  * Indication of the node's keys are present
  * Indication of the contractor’s keys are rpesent
  * Incoming Trust Amount (ITA)
  * Outgoing Trust Amount (OTA)
  * Current Balance (CB)

Contractor’s ID is a positive integer number (4B) that is used by the node for the simplified identification of other nodes, as well as for a number of subsequent commands.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>


## Transaction Set Outgoing Trust Amount (OTA)

```
SET:contractors/trust-lines
```

|Argument|Type|Description
|---|---|---|
| Contractor ID | `uint32` | Internal ID of the neighbor node, obtained from the TL List. |
| Amount |Pos. BinInt, <br/> up to 2^256| New value of the Outgoing Trust Amount (OTA). |
| Equivalent ID | `uint32` | ID if the [equivalent](https://github.com/GEO-Protocol/specs-protocol/blob/master/trust_lines/trust_lines.md#trust-lines-equivalents) in which TL (Trust Line) should be opened: an integer greater than 0. |

This command sets/updates amount of outgoing Trust Line. <br/>
It is expected that trust line to the contractor with corresponding ID is already present (initialised).
Transaction involves both current node and contractor's node.
`todo:` add link to te transaction in source code.

**Note:** If you set a new OTA  value to 0, then the Outgoing Trust Line will be closed.

### Example
Change the OTA to the value of 5000 to the contractor with the ID 1 in the equivalent 1:

```
> echo -e "13e5cf8c-5834-4e52-b65b-f9281dd1ff91\tSET:contractors/trust-lines\t1\t5000\t1\n" > fifo/commands.fifo
```

![init_trust_line.png](https://github.com/GEO-Protocol/Documentation/blob/master/resources/tl_set.png)

### Response
Code 200: OK, operation was performed well. No additional data is provided. <br/>
Code different than 200 indicates an error. Please, refer to the node's codes list for the details.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>


## Transaction: Closing Incoming Trust Line

```
DELETE:contractors/incoming-trust-line
```

|Argument|Type|Description
|---|---|---|

| Equivalent ID | `uint32` | ID if the [equivalent](https://github.com/GEO-Protocol/specs-protocol/blob/master/trust_lines/trust_lines.md#trust-lines-equivalents) in which TL (Trust Line) should be opened: an integer greater than 0. |

This command is used to reject incoming Trust Line from the neigbor node.
Transaction involves both current node and contractor's node.
In case if contractor's node does not responds - operation is forced to be done on the current node.
`todo:` add link to te transaction in source code.

### Example
```
> echo -e "13e5cf8c-5834-4e52-b65b-f9281dd1ff91\tDELETE:contractors/incoming-trust-line\t0\t1\n" > fifo/commands.fifo
```

![tl_close_incoming.png](https://github.com/GEO-Protocol/Documentation/blob/master/resources/tl_close_incoming.png)

### Response
Code 200: OK, operation was performed well. No additional data is provided. <br/>
Code different than 200 indicates an error. Please, refer to the node's codes list for the details.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## Transaction: Calculate Max Flow
```
GET:contractors/transactions/max/fully
```

|Argument|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
| Number of contractors | `uint32` | How many contractors would be list into the command |
| Contractors list |`list` | List of contractors to which max payment flow should be calculated |

### Contractors fields
|Field|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
| Address type | `enum` | Only IPv4 Addresses are supported at the moment, code 12. |
| Address | `string` | Corresponding address representation. |
| Equivalent ID | `uint32` |  ID if the [equivalent](https://github.com/GEO-Protocol/specs-protocol/blob/master/trust_lines/trust_lines.md#trust-lines-equivalents) in which TL (Trust Line) should be opened: an integer greater than 0. |

This transaction combines routing algorithm and flow prediciton algorithm and tries to efficiently scan the network topology and to  calculate max. payment flow from the issuer node to each one node, that is listed in arguments. There is no need for direct TLs presence between issuer node and listed nodes: it would be enough if there would exist some paths that are connecting this nodes via some internal nodes. GEO Protocol supports paths that are up to nodes 7 long (icluding command issuer node and the destination node).

### Example
```
> echo -e "13e5cf8c-5834-4e52-b65b-f9281dd1ff91\tGET:contractors/transactions/max/fully\t3\t12\t127.0.0.1:2001\t12\t127.0.0.1:2003\t12\t127.0.0.1:2000\t1\n" > fifo/commands.fifo
```
![max_flow_prediction.png](https://github.com/GEO-Protocol/Documentation/blob/master/resources/max_flow_prediction.png)

## Transaction: Payment
```
CREATE:contractors/transactions
```

|Argument|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
| Number of contractors | `uint32` | How many contractors would be list into the command. |
| List of contractor addresses |`list` | List of addresses that are related to the contractor (node, that should receive the payment). |

### Addresses fields
|Field|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
| Address type | `enum` | Only IPv4 Addresses are supported at the moment, code 12. |
| Address | `string` | Corresponding address representation. |

This command initilises payment operation from current node to the contractor. Addresses received in arguments are used for the communication with remote node. Only one address is used at a time. 

### Example
```
> echo -e "13e5cf8c-5834-4e52-b65b-f9281dd1ff91\tCREATE:contractors/transactions\t1\t12\t127.0.0.1:2003\t2000\t1\n" > fifo/commands.fifo
```

### Response
Result codes:

`201` – completed successfully. </br>
`401` – protocol error (some conditions are not met).</br>
`409` – consensus has not been reached (some nodes doesn't approved the operation).</br>
`412` – insufficient payment possibilities (isufficient funds).</br>
`444` – the contractor is not reachable (remote node seems to be down).</br>
`462` – no payment paths (no connection is possible between sender and receiver node).</br>
</br>
When receiving the code `201`, the result will also contains `transaction UUID` – UUID4 id of the transaction that was performed.
</br>
</br>
</br>

## Transaction: Get History of Operations With a TL
```
GET:history/trust-lines
```
Returns list of records, that represents operations that was done with a Trust Line (except payments), for example: amount changes, opening datetime, closing datetime, etc. 

|Argument|Type|Description
|---|---|---|
| Offset | `uint64` | Number of the record from which the scan should be started. |
| Count | `uint64` | Amount of records that should be returned. |
| Lower Datime/Time Bound| `UNIX timestamp` | Filter by the date/time (from). If not present - must be set to "null". 
| Upper Datime/Time Bound| `UNIX timestamp` | Filter by the date/time (up to). If not present - must be set to "null". 

The Shift and the Number of operations parameters are used to get history in portions. The numbering of records starts with 0. Filters are UNIX timestamps. If no filtration is required, then these parameters must be set to null. It is possible to filter with both filters at the same time or with only one of them.

### Example
An example of the getting history of operations with a TL command:
```
> echo -e "13e5cf8c-5834-4e52-b65b-f9281dd1ff91\tGET:history/trust-lines\t0\t100\tnull\t1536759923\t1\n" > fifo/commands.fifo
```

## Response
* `200` – completed successfully; <br/>
* Number of operations returend; <br/>
* List of operations:
  * `transaction UUID`;
  * Date/Time (UNIX timestamp);
  * Address of the contractor;
  * Type of operation with the TL;
  * Amount;
<br/>
The type of operation with TL can be as follows: (`todo` specify ENUM of types)
* Opening
* Accepting
* Setting
* Updating
* Closing
* Rejecting
* Closing Incoming
* Rejecting Outgoing

The sum is different from zero only in Setting and Updating operations (change of trust), 
in the rest of the cases it equals 0.

If the `offset` and the `cuont` parameters will set more operations than the actual number of operations, then the result will only return the existing operations, that meet the command’s criteria.

Example of a history of operations with TLs result (3 operations):
```

## Transaction: Get Payment History
```
GET:history/payments
```

|Argument|Type|Description
|---|---|---|
| Offset | `uint64` | Number of the record from which the scan should be started. |
| Count | `uint64` | Amount of records that should be returned. |
| Lower Datime/Time Bound| `UNIX timestamp` | Filter by the date/time (from). If not present - must be set to "null". 
| Upper Datime/Time Bound| `UNIX timestamp` | Filter by the date/time (up to). If not present - must be set to "null".
| Lower Amount Bound| `+BigInt` </br> Up to `2^256` | Filter by the amount (from). If not present - must be set to "null". 
| Upper Amount Bound| `+BigInt` </br> Up to `2^256` | Filter by the amount (up to). If not present - must be set to "null".
| Command UUID | `UUID4` | Filter by command. If not present - must be set to "null". if present - the search is carried out only on it without taking into account other parameters.

### Example
An example of the receiving a history of operations with TL command:
```
> echo -e "13e5cf8c-5834-4e52-b65b-f9281dd1ff91\tGET:history/payments\t0\t100\tnull\t1536759923\t500\tnull\tnull\t1\n" > fifo/commands.fifo
```

### Response
* `200` – completed successfully
* Number of operations
* List of operations
* transactionUUID
* Time: UNIX timestamp
* Address of the contractor
* Type of payment
* Amount
* The node balance after the operation

The type of payment may be as follows:
* Incoming (an incoming payment)
* Outgoing (an outgoing payment)

The resulting balance after operation is the sum of balances for all TLs after the current operation in equivalent of the transaction.

Example of the history of payments command result (3 operations):
